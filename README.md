To develop a system that meets the requirements specified, we will break down the implementation into several key components: the backend microservice, the frontend application, and the integration with Zapier for automation. Below is a detailed outline of the approach and the technologies to be used.

Technologies Used:
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (for storing user and invoice data)
Frontend: React.js, React Router, Axios (for API calls)
Authentication: Google OAuth
Automation: Zapier
Deployment: Heroku (for backend), Netlify (for frontend)


Backend Microservice (Node.js)

Step 1: Set Up Node.js and Express
Initialize a new Node.js project.
Install necessary dependencies: Express, Mongoose, Passport, Passport-Google-OAuth20, dotenv, and Axios.

Step 2: Configure Google OAuth
Create a new Google Cloud project and set up OAuth 2.0 credentials.
Configure Passport with Google OAuth strategy.

Step 3: Set Up Express Server and Routes
Create routes for authentication, invoice details, and Zapier integration.

Step 4: Define MongoDB Models
Define User and Invoice models.


Frontend Application (React)

Step 1: Set Up React Project
Create a new React project using Create React App.
Install necessary dependencies: React Router, Axios.

Step 2: Implement Google OAuth Login
Set up the login page and Google OAuth flow.

Step 3: Display Invoice Details
Create a dashboard page to display due invoices.

Step 4: Set Up Routing
Set up React Router to handle routing.

Integration with Zapier
Create a Zap in Zapier that triggers on webhook events.

Set up the Zap to send email reminders when a webhook is received.

Step 1: Create a Webhook Trigger in Zapier
In Zapier, create a new Zap and select "Webhook" as the trigger.
Set up the webhook to receive POST requests.

Step 2: Set Up Email Action
Add an action to send an email reminder when the webhook is triggered.

Deployment
Deploy the Node.js backend to Heroku.
Deploy the React frontend to Netlify.

Bonus Features (Optional)
Implement scheduling for automation actions.
Allow users to customize email templates.
Track the status of reminders and follow-ups in the dashboard.
By following these steps, we will have a system that allows users to log in using Google OAuth, view due invoices, and automate the process of sending reminders through Zapier.
